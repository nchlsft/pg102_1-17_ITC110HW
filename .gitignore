1. What is [ ]?
The brackets define a list.

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to?
d

4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
‘d’ - starts from left side

5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
['a', 'b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].
6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1 - (3.14 would be 0)

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', true] - Removes the value before cat

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
list concatenation is + and list replication is *

10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
append is adding values the argument to the end of the list, and inster() you can instert them anywhere in the list

11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
remove() 

12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
loops

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
lists can be changed and tuples can’t be changed

14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
list() and tuple() will return list and tuple versions

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
True

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
cop.deepcopy() copies lists within lists
